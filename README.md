    1. Data Exploration and Analysis: Conduct thorough data exploration and analysis to gain insights into the data's characteristics, patterns, and relationships. Use appropriate visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data better.
	
    2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for modeling. Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies appropriately.
    3. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance and capture relevant information from the data.
    4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or statistical models based on the problem type and data characteristics. Consider the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive power.
    5. Model Training and Evaluation: Split the data into training and test sets and train the model on the training data. Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using relevant evaluation metrics.
    6. Model Interpretability: Pay attention to model interpretability, especially if the project has real-world implications, use feature importance to explain model predictions.
    7. Documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your project. Describe the problem statement, data sources, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
    8. Data Visualization: Use effective data visualizations to communicate insights and model results. Visuals should be clear, informative, and visually appealing.
    9. Model Deployment: Consider the deployment of the trained model in a real-world scenario if applicable. Discuss how the model can be integrated into an existing system or make predictions in real-time.

Limitation and what can be improved
Combine this model with with a regression model to predict how much of a credit limit an applicant will be approved for.
Hyperparameter tuning with grid search or random search.
Better interpretation of the chi-square test
Retrain the model without the least predictive features
